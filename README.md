# EP_CheemsCubes
###### The initials EP in any repository stand for Educational Project. These are course projects and personal experiments for learning. 

I was asked to do some HTML and Css as part of a very basic academic exercise
I wanted to do something to do with Cheems and CSS in 3D, so I made cubes with Cheems faces
